<html><h1>Enrichment plot for Default</h1>
        The plot displays 10 locally maximal kmers and their neighbourhoods. 
        The locality is defined by huddinge distance and the maximality by mean_ln_fold.
        In the plot, distance from the origin is the mean_ln_fold value for each point. 
        The 10 local maxima are set to locations minimizing the sum of squared error 
        between their Euclidean distance on 2D plot and their Huddinge distances.
        The non-maximal points are allocated to the representative local maxima reached by up-hill climbing 
        from the point in question. The point color represents its distance to 
        its representative local maxima. There is random i.i.d jitter on the angle of the 
        non-maximal points. The circle is at the globally maximal enrichment<p>
