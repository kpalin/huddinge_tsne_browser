Tool to browse sequence kmers laid out in 2D with TSNE approximating Huddinge distance.

The system has bit of dependencies with holoviews >=1.9.2 and jupyter
covering most of them. Those are easiest to install from conda. If
you're lucky, you might be able to install everything with just
`conda -c kpalin huddinge_tsne_browser`)

To use the package efficiently, you should download, install and run
the jupyter notebook `examples/Huddinge TSNE browser 2.ipynb` from the
github repository.
