Tool to browse sequence kmers laid out in 2D with TSNE approximating
Huddinge distance.

The system has bit of dependencies with holoviews \>=1.9.2 and jupyter
covering most of them. Those are easiest to install from conda. If
you're lucky, you might be able to install everything with just
`conda -c kpalin huddinge\_tsne\_browser`

To use the package efficiently, you should download, install and run the
jupyter notebook examples/Huddinge TSNE browser 2.ipynb from the github
repository. A static sample can be [browsed in nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kpalin/huddinge_tsne_browser/blob/master/examples/Huddinge%20TSNE%20browser%202.ipynb)
